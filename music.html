            “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly by teaching in all wisdom, and by admonishing with psalms, 
            hymns, and spiritual songs, with thankfulness, singing in your heart to God” (Colossians 3:16).

            The great reformer of the 16th century, Martin Luther, said, “Next to the Word of God, the noble art of 
            music is the greatest treasure in the world.” Music is a glory. One of the first things a new Christian 
            does is sing. Redeemed, rescued people sing. The Bible records a glorious Song of Redemption: “The LORD 
            is my strength and my song; He has become my salvation” (Exodus 15:2).

            Singing is a part of the teaching ministry of the church (Colossians 3:16). Songs are double-didactic. 
            That is, they are taught, and they teach. God told Moses, “Write down this song and teach it to the 
            Israelites and have them sing it, so that it may be a witness for me against them” (Deuteronomy 31:19). 
            Christians are commanded to sing (Psalm 149:1). C.S. Lewis said, “We delight to praise what we enjoy 
            because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment; it is its appointed consummation.”

            The Bible commends rich diversity in song. There are songs of battle (Judges 5), songs of David 
            (Psalms), songs of the prophets (Ezra 3:10–13; Nehemiah 12:27–29; Isaiah 52:9; Jeremiah 20:13; 
            Zephaniah 3:14). In the final book of our Bible, we have harps of God and singing (Revelation 15:3–4). 
            We aim to imitate this musical diversity by broad instrumental accompaniment and by singing a variety 
            of “psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.” We reject the notion that the Christian church must sing 
            psalms only. We equally reject the practice common among our baptist brethren of singing hymns only. 
            After all, the first book published in North America was the Bay Psalm Book (1640).

            Furthermore, we distinguish between songs for congregational use (public benefit) and songs for private 
            use (personal preferences). Although the borders that divide psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs as 
            distinct categories are fuzzy, we believe the sum total purpose of this variety is the edification of 
            the body unto the glory of God. Yet, because the object of our singing is not us but the living God, 
            we take great care to offer what is acceptable to Him (Hebrews 12:28) in form and content. And both 
            are driven by a desire to please God and so edify His people. As Charles Spurgeon once remarked, “Fine 
            music without devotion is but a splendid garment upon a corpse.” In the presence of our King, we offer 
            our best, in spirit and in truth (John 4:24).

            One of the last things Jesus does before He goes to the cross is establish the basic pattern for our 
            weekly public worship. Though there was a traitor in their midst, Jesus gathers His followers together 
            in the upper room (Mark 14:17). He teaches them (Mark 14:18–25). He prays with them (Mark 14:22–23). 
            He leads them in the communion meal: “This is My blood of the covenant which is poured out for many” 
            (Mark 14:24). And just before they depart, they sing together (Mark 14:26).

            Music is where our purpose as a church reaches its crescendo, where knowing, loving, and enjoying 
            Christ Jesus is gloriously climaxed. If singing and music is a cross to you, take it up and you will 
            find it a blessing. Dark and miserable will be our days if we go to our graves singing lightly or 
            not at all. But if we face this world in song, singing the glories of our Redeemer who conquered the 
            grave, all will be well with us.

            “The aim and final end of all music should be non other than the glory of God and the refreshment 
            of the soul” (J.S. Bach).
