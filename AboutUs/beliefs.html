            We adopt as the fullest expression of our faith the Second London Baptist Confession of Faith 
            of 1689 (2LBC). The ultimate authority in all matters of faith and practice is the Bible alone, 
            a truth which is clearly set forth in the opening article of the Confession itself. This historic 
            document, albeit imperfect, is an excellent summary of the things most surely believed among us, 
            and we find it to be an assistance in controversy, a confirmation in faith, and a means of 
            edification in righteousness.

            Other creeds and confessions express an important part of who we are as a church. We confess and 
            believe together with our fathers in the faith and our brothers throughout the world (1 Cor 14:36; 
            Gal 3:28; 1 Cor 3:1–4). We are baptized into their company as members of the same body, the Church 
            of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with them we eat of a common loaf and drink from a common cup; their 
            creed is our creed, even as their life is our life—one Lord, one faith, and one baptism (Eph 4:4–6). 
            We therefore subscribe to the following, holding them to be a faithful witness to what the 
            Scriptures teach, and as a means of identifying with the broader Church: the Apostles’ Creed, the 
            Nicene Creed, the Definition of Chalcedon, the Athanasian Creed, and the Canons of Dort. Click a
