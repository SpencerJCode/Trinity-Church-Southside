            Desiring to govern ourselves according to the principles of Scripture and to do all things in love, 
            we, the members of Trinity Church Southside, do ordain and establish the following articles, to 
            which we voluntarily submit ourselves.

        <div class="text_spaced">
            SECTION 1. In submission to the Scripture, we confess the purpose of this church is to glorify 
            God (Rom. 11:36; 1 Cor 10:31; Eph 3:20–21) through knowing (2 Cor 11:3; Col 3:2), loving (Dt 6:4–9;
             Mt 22:34–40; Jn 14:15), and enjoying (Job 22:24–26; Hab 3:17–18; Phil 4:4) Christ Jesus 
             (2 Cor 4:1–6; Col 1:13–20; Phil 2:5–11) by the Spirit (Mt 3:16–17; Jn 15:26).

    </div>
    <div class="article_content">
        <div class="text_spaced">
            SECTION 2. The primary means for the accomplishment of this purpose are the public and private 
            ministry of the Word of God, prayer, fellowship, and the ordinances of baptism and the Lord’s 
            Supper (Acts 2:41–43). 
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="article_content">
        <div class="text_spaced">
            SECTION 3. To fulfill this purpose, this church will endeavor by the grace of the Lord to 
            cultivate and practice the basic Christian principles of love (Mt 22:34–40; John 13:34–35; 
            Rom 13:10; 1 Cor 13) and self-denial (Mt 16:24–28; Phil 2:1–5).

    <div class="article_content">
        <div class="text_spaced">
            SECTION 1. We adopt as the fullest expression of our faith the Second London Baptist Confession 
            of Faith of 1689 (2LBC). The ultimate authority in all matters of faith and practice is the 
            Bible alone, which truth is clearly set forth in the opening article of the Confession itself. 
            This historic document, albeit imperfect, is an excellent summary of the things most surely 
            believed among us, and we find it to be an assistance in controversy, a confirmation in faith, 
            and a means of edification in righteousness.  
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="article_content">
        <div class="text_spaced">
            SECTION 2. Other creeds and confessions express an important part of who we are as a church. We 
            confess and believe together with our fathers in the faith and our brothers throughout the world
             (1 Cor 14:36; Gal 3:28; 1 Cor 3:1–4). We are baptized into their company as members of the same
              body, the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with them we eat of a common loaf and drink 
              from a common cup; their creed is our creed, even as their life is our life—one Lord, one 
              faith, and one baptism (Eph 4:4–6). We therefore subscribe to the following, holding them to 
              be a faithful witness to what the Scriptures teach, and as a means of identifying with the 
              broader Church: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, the Definition of Chalcedon, the 
              Athanasian Creed, and the Canons of Dort.

            SECTION 1. We acknowledge no ecclesiastical authority other than our Lord Jesus Christ, who is 
            the Head of the Church (Eph. 5:23) and who directs the affairs of the church through elders 
            chosen and ordained according to the precepts of Holy Scripture (Acts 14:21–23; 1 Tim 3:1–13; 
            Titus 1:5–9). The elders themselves at all times and in all their activities stand under the 
            authority of Holy Scripture (Acts 16:4; 1 Cor 7:17).

            SECTION 2. The church should cooperate with other like-minded churches in matters of mutual 
            interest and concern (2 Cor 8:18–24). We may seek the assistance (1 Cor 16:1–2) and should 
            seek the counsel (Prov 11:14; 1 Thes 2:14) of other churches in matters of special importance
             and concern to us, but the decision of no other church, group of churches, or council shall 
             ever be binding on this church (Acts 14:21–23; Phil 4:15; 2LBC 26:15).

            SECTION 3. In addition to respecting the principles articulated in our Book of Confessions

            concern which threaten the integrity, unity, or biblical order of this congregation (Acts 15:2).

            The Advisory Council shall consist of five elders chosen by our elders from at least three 
            sister churches with whom we have close fellowship. The choice of these five men shall be 
            reviewed each year prior to the annual church meeting. The consent of those to be proposed 
            shall be obtained and the names of the five men shall be announced at the annual meeting by

              Christ (Acts 2:37–42; 5:14; 8:12; 16:30–34; 20:21), who manifests a life transformed by the

            Paragraph A. Pastoral Examination. A person who desires to become a member of this church shall
             make it know to the elders by submitting a completed membership form. The elders will visit 
             with the individual and seek to determine whether that person has a credible profession of 
             faith in Christ, believes the Bible as contained in the sixty-six books of the Old and New 
             Testaments to be the inspired Word of God and the only rule of faith and obedience, is in 
             agreement with the Apostles’ Creed, has been baptized, is willing to submit to the government
              and discipline of this church, is capable of assuming the responsibilities and liabilities 
              of church membership, and intends to give wholehearted support to its ministry (Acts 9:26–27
              ; 10:47–48 with 11:2–18; 11:23).

    <div class="article_content">

            Paragraph B. Pastoral Inquiry. If the prospective member is or has been a member of another 
            church, efforts will be made to determine the person’s standing in that church and his reasons
             for leaving (Acts 15:1–2 with 24–25). If a former church raises an objection which the elders
              consider valid (3 Jn 8–10), membership may be denied or delayed at the discretion of the 
              elders.

            Paragraph C. Congregational Counsel. If the elders are satisfied that the prospective member 
            meets the requirements for membership, they shall announce the same to the congregation at a
             stated meeting of the church. At least two weeks will be allowed for objections or questions
              to be raised privately with the elders concerning the applicant’s manner of life or 
              doctrine. If no objection is raised, the person will be publicly received into the 
              membership during the next public gathering on the Lord’s Day. The elders shall postpone 
              the reception of a person into membership until any objections are investigated and

            and His gospel work for their salvation and their commitment to His Lordship by endeavoring 
            to love (Jn 13:34–35), by practicing self-denial through the ordinary means of grace (the 
            word, prayer, and fellowship; Acts 2:42), and by submitting to the government and discipline 
            of the church (Heb 13:17; see Article VI Section 1). They then shall be asked to read and 
            affirm their belief in the articles of faith expressed in the Apostles’ Creed. The members 
            of the congregation shall then be asked to express their consent to his reception (Acts 9:

            SECTION 4. Termination of Membership.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="article_content">
        <div class="text_spaced">
            <span>Paragraph A. Ways of Termination.</span>
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) By Death. When a member of the church dies, his name shall be removed from the 
                membership roll (Heb 12:23).</span><br>
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) By Transfer. When it is so requested, the elders may grant to a member in good 
                standing a letter of commendation to another church (Acts 18:27). No such letter may 
                be given to a member who is under corrective church discipline. The elders may refuse
                 to send a letter of commendation to any church which is in their judgment disloyal 
                 to the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints (Jude 3) or which does 
                 not exercise godly care over its members (Heb 13:17).</span><br>
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) By Resignation. Membership in Trinity Church Southside is entered and initiated 
                jointly, by voluntary commitment from the individual and consent by the church, 
                expressed in terms of the procedures described in Section 3 of this Article. 
                Accordingly, members cannot ordinarily terminate their membership unilaterally. As a 
                general rule, a member may voluntarily resign from membership in Trinity Church 
                Southside. In such cases, the member should first consult with the elders. However, 
                a resignation offered 	by a person guilty of sin which warrants corrective discipline
                 will be regarded as invalid, and the church may proceed with public censure, suspension
                  of privileges, or excommunication in accordance with the procedures outlined in 
                  Article VI (Acts 15:24; 1 Jn 2:18–19 with 2 Jn 7–11).</span><br>
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) By Exclusion. If a member ceases to encourage others by abandoning the regular 
                fellowship of the church without showing just cause (Heb 10:24–25), he may be excluded 
                from the membership. In such cases the elders shall try to contact the person and 
                resolve the situation (Ezek 34:4). If these efforts are unavailing, the elders shall 
                recommend to the congregation that the person be excluded. If a member not guilty of 
                sin which warrants corrective discipline renounces his commitment to submit to the 
                government and discipline of this church in keeping with the requirements of membership
                 listed in Section 1 or Section 2 paragraph D of this Article (Num 30:2; Deut. 23:21–23;
                  Ps 15:4; 24:4; Mt 5:37), and yet refuses to resign voluntarily, he may be excluded, 
                  but only after due admonition from the elders (2 Tim 2:24–26). In such cases the 
                  elders shall announce to the congregation by letter their recommendation to exclude 
                  the person and the grounds for such an action. Opportunity will be given for questions
                  , and if no objection is raised which the elders consider to be valid, the members of 
                  the congregation shall be asked to express their consent to the exclusion on the 
                  appointed Lord’s Day. The elders will inform the person, when feasible, that he is no
                   longer a member.</span><br>
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) By Excommunication. According to the teaching of the Holy Scripture, a congregation 
                must cut off from its fellowship and membership any person who teaches or insists on 
                holding heretical doctrine, who impenitently conducts himself in a manner inconsistent 
                with his Christian profession, or who persists in disturbing the unity, peace, or purity 
                of the church (Mt 18:15ff; Rom 16:17–20; 1 Cor 5:1ff; Titus 3:10–11). The procedure to 
                be followed in such excommunication is set forth in Section 2 of Article VI of this 
                Constitution.</span>

            <span>Paragraph B. Implications of Termination.</span>
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Trinity Church Southside does not exist in isolation from, but is part of the 
                universal church of Christ, composed of all true churches (Gal 1:13, 22; Eph 3:21). Accordingly, 
                open and forthright communication among the churches is vital for the purity, peace, edification,
                 and unity of the church universal. Therefore the elders may, at their discretion, disclose to 
                 the members of Trinity Church Southside and to other churches the circumstances under which a 
                 person’s membership was terminated (Acts 15:24; 1 Tim 1:20; 2 Tim 2:17; 4:10).</span><br>
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In addition, Trinity Church Southside does not exist in isolation from society at 
                large. Accordingly, Trinity Church Southside has a moral obligation both to act with integrity and 
                to maintain its testimony before the civil authorities and society in general (2 Cor 8:20–21). 
                Therefore, the elders may, at their discretion, disclose to persons outside the ecclesiastical 
                circles mentioned above the circumstances under which a person’s membership was terminated (Lev 
                5:1; Prov 29:24; Rom 13:1–7; 1 Pet 4:15).</span><br>
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Termination of membership does not give license to former members to sow discord, 
                to spread false teachings or slander, or to engage in any other behavior which threatens the peace 
                and unity of this church or the church universal. Accordingly, when it is established that a 
                former member is behaving divisively, the elders may issue whatever warnings they deem appropriate 
                to preserve the peace and harmony of this congregation and the church universal (Acts 15:24; 
                Rom 16:17–20; 1 Tim 1:20; 2 Tim 2:17; 4:14–15). </span><br>

            SECTION 1. General Statement. All the teaching and instruction which takes place in Christ’s church 
            is part of its discipline and training (Mt 28:20). The Scriptures teach that God disciplines, and that 
            He does so using a variety of means: persecution and hardship (Heb. 12:3–11), sickness (1 Cor 11:23–34), 
            death (Acts 5:1–11; 1 Cor 11:23–24), and the local church (Mt 18:15–20). In the local church, this 
            discipline includes both formative measures such as preaching, teaching, exhortation, imitation, etc. 
            (2 Tim 4:1–2; Heb 3:12–13; 12:3–11; Titus 2:7) and corrective measures such as public admonition, 
            suspension of privileges, and censures (Mt 18:15–17; Titus 3:10). The goal of all church discipline 
            include God’s glory in the church, the welfare and purity of the church, the integrity and effectiveness 
            of the church’s witness, the sanctification and salvation of God’s people, and the restoration and 
            spiritual growth of the offender.

    <div class="article_content">
        <div class="text_spaced">
            There are occasions when formative discipline alone is insufficient, and corrective discipline becomes 
            necessary (e.g. in cases of heretical doctrine, scandalous conduct, or serious unresolved personal 
            offenses). All forms of corrective discipline are ultimately corporate and public acts. As a general 
            rule and whenever feasible, the elders will make an effort to bring the offending party to repentance 
            through private means (Gal 6:1; Jas 5:19–20) before more public steps are taken. Nevertheless, the 
            character of the sin or the circumstances of the sin may necessitate public corrective discipline 
            whether or not any private means have been implemented by the elders. In each cases of corrective 
            discipline, the principles and procedures of the Scriptures must be applied judiciously. The 
            paragraphs that follow set forth the various forms of church discipline identified in the Bible, 
            but do not constitute a fixed procedural order.

            Paragraph A. The Corrective Discipline of Public Admonition. When a church member sins in such a way 
            that the offense may not be righteously overlooked (Prov 19:11; 1 Pet 4:8), he may be admonished by 
            the elders and called to repentance before the gathered church. For those who remain impenitent, 
            further corrective discipline may be enacted (Mt 18:15–17; Luke 17:3; Titus 3:10–11). Those who humbly 
            received the word of public admonition, own and confess their sin, and manifest appropriate fruits of 
            repentance (Prov 28:13) shall afterward be publicly commended for their godly repentance (2 Cor 7:7–11).

    <div class="article_content">
        <div class="text_spaced">
            Paragraph B. The Corrective Discipline of Suspension of Privileges. Some sin by a member requires the 
            suspension of some or all of the privileges of church membership in keeping with the nature and gravity 
            of the offense (2 Thes 3:14–15). This suspension must be enforced by the members of the church. 
            Nevertheless, the elders of the church may, at their discretion, suspend the privileges of a member in 
            anticipation of the public disclosure of the sin (1 Cor 11:27; 1 Pet 5:1–2). As soon as possible, the 
            elders shall make the sin of the member known to the congregation. Suspension shall be imposed by 
            consent of the congregation following the procedure outlined in Section 3 of this Article. In all cases 
            of suspension, the offending person is still to be regarded as a brother in Christ and as a member of 
            the church (2 Thes 3:14–15). If the suspended member persists in his impenitence, additional 
            disciplinary action may be required.

            In some cases, a member’s sin may be so heinous, blatant, scandalous, or dangerous that it warrants the

            formal disciplinary action (1 Cor 5:4–5).

            <span>Paragraph C. Excommunication.</span>
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) General Statement. When the sinning member persists in unrepentance or exhibits 
                extended and repeated patterns of some sin or is discovered to have been leading a duplicitous life 
                of sin and unbelief, the church may move to excommunicate the member. Under ordinary circumstances, 
                before a member is excommunicated, due time is to be allowed for his repentance following the 
                discipline of public admonition, censures, and suspension of church privileges. If the sinner 
                does not repent, he is to be excommunicated (Mt 18:17–20; Jn 20:23; 1 Cor 5; Rev 2:21; 1 Tim 
                5:24; 2 Cor 6:14). Excommunication is a serious, sober, judicial, and punitive act whereby the 
                unrepentant member is purged from the community of believers, effectively having his baptism 
                publicly revoked (1 Cor 5:13; Mt 18:18–20).</span><br>
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Treatment of the excommunicated individual. An excommunicated individual is to 
                be treated as an unbeliever in that he has lost all privileges of church membership (Mt 18:17). He 
                is treated more severely than any other unbeliever in that, being under punishment, he is denied 
                certain privileges of social interaction (2 Cor 2:6; 1 Cor 5:9, 11). He is treated better than any 
                other unbeliever, however, in that he has a great claim upon the admonitions, prayers, and 
                affections of the brethren. The goal of these continued prayers and admonitions, together with the 
                punitive withdrawal of distinctively Christian fellowship, is to effect biblical repentance through 
                a sense of sorrow and shame (2 Cor 2:7).</span><br>
            <span>If an excommunicated person gives satisfactory evidence of true repentance, the congregation shall

            Paragraph A. Procedure for the Suspension or Excommunication of a Member. At a congregational meeting, 
            the elders shall recommend to the members that the sinning member be disciplined or excommunicated. The 
            elders will clearly identify the type of action being recommended (censure, suspension of privileges, or 
            excommunication), and delineate the strictures associated with that action. In order to enable the 
            members to consent with biblical conviction and a good conscience, the elders will state their reasons 
            for the discipline and provide supporting evidence that warrants the discipline.

            Paragraph B. Procedure for the Restoration of a Suspended Member or Excommunicated Individual. Since 
            corrective discipline and excommunication are corporate acts, restoration is a corporate activity. 
            When the elders deem that a suspended member or excommunicated individual is manifesting satisfactory 
            evidence of true repentance (2 Cor 2:6–8; 7:9–11), they shall recommend to the church that the person 
            be restored. In order to enable the members to consent with biblical conviction and a good conscience, 
            the elders shall provide reasons for the restoration of the disciplined member or excommunicated 
            individual and the evidence of his repentance. In some cases, the person’s privileges may be restored 
            or the strictures against him lifted in stages.

            and the purity of its life and doctrine (Titus 1:9–11). If and when such persons should trouble the 
            church, the elders may name them, identify their errors, and warn the members not to associate with 
            them (Rom 16:17).

            Section 1. Foundational Principles. Trinity Church Southside is a Christ-ruled, Christ-governed, 
            and Christ-led assembly. Jesus Christ alone is the Head of the church (Eph 5:23; Col 1:18), and He 
            governs His church through qualified men whom He appoints (Acts 20:8; Eph 4:11) and who are endowed 
            by His Spirit with the gifts and graces needed to accomplish their work (1 Tim 3:1–13). Because 
            Christ appoints qualified men to serve as church officers, they have authority (2 Cor 13:10) and 
            their authority is limited by Him in the Scriptures (1 Cor 14:36–38; 2 Tim 3:16–17). There are 
            two kinds of church officers: elders and deacons (Phil 1:1; 1 Tim 3:1–13).

            It is the duty of the church to seek to discover among its members those to whom Christ the Lord has 
            imparted the graces and gifts necessary for office (Acts 6:3), and to set them apart by united prayer 
            (Acts 6:6), and then to submit to their authority (Lk 10:16; Jn 13:20; Heb 13:17). Church officers 
            are not exempt from church discipline, but on the contrary, their office obliges them to adhere to a 
            more rigorous standard of conduct than other members (Jas 3:1).

    <div class="article_content">
        <div class="text_spaced">
            (1) Ground of Their Authority. The Head of the church (Col 1:18) has given the Scriptures to His church 
            as an infallible and unchanging rule of practice (2 Tim 3:16–17; Mt 28:20; 2 Thes 2:15; 1 Tim 3:14–15; 
            4:11), to which the elders are always bound in discharging the duties of their office (1 Cor 14:36–38). 
            They are “elders” because they are spiritually mature leaders, and examples to the congregation (1 Peter 
            5:1–3). Elders are called “bishops” (or “overseers”) because they are charged with the oversight of the 
            assembly (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet 5:2), “pastors” because they shepherd the flock of God (Acts 20:28), and 
            “rulers” because they govern and care for the house of God (1 Tim 3:5; Heb 13:17,24). Insofar as the 
            instruction of the elders is in accord with the Scriptures, that instruction carries with it the 
            authority of Christ Himself (Lk 10:16). Where the Scriptures give explicit or implicit direction to 
            the church on any issue, this direction is always to be obeyed (Jn 14:21). Where no regulative word 
            from Christ is given, elders must exercise their authority in subjection to the general principles of 
            Scripture and to the light of nature and Christian prudence (1 Cor 11:13–14; 14:40; 2LBC 1:6b).

    <div class="article_content">
        <div class="text_spaced">
            (2) Sphere and Limits of Their Authority. The Word of God defines the sphere and limits of the authority 
            of elders. The eldership, as a body, is authorized and responsible to give comprehensive oversight to 
            the church (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet 5:1–3), including the preaching and teaching of the whole counsel of God 
            (Acts 20:20–21, 27; Titus 1:9), the watching out for the welfare of the soul of every member of the 
            church (Eph 4:11–13; Col 1:28; 1 Thes 2:11; Heb 13:17), and the directing of the church in all its 
            tasks (1 Tim 3:4–5). Nonetheless, the elders must exercise this authority with sensitivity to the 
            congregation (Ezek 34:4; Acts 6:5) and in the posture of servants and as examples to them (Mt 20:25–28; 
            1 Pet 5:3). Therefore, the elders should seek the support of the congregation respecting any major 
            endeavor. They should also carefully consider congregational input when to do so would serve the 
            interests of the church and would not involve the elders in a sinful relinquishment of their 
            God-given responsibilities or authority (1 Tim 3:5; Acts 19:30; 21:11–14).

    <div class="article_content">

            According to the Scripture the elders may not impose officers on the church, nor may they excommunicate 
            any member without the consent of the congregation (Acts 6:3–6; Mt 18:17; 1 Cor 5:4–5; 2 Thes 3:14). 
            Furthermore, congregational consent is required for any change to this Constitution and for receiving, 
            suspending, or excluding members of the church.

            Paragraph B. Plurality of Elders. The Scriptures teach that normally there should be a plurality of 
            elders in each local church (Acts 14:23; 20:17; Phil 1:1; Titus 1:5). Therefore the church should 
            endeavor to discover and then formally to recognize all the men whom the Holy Spirit has endowed 
            with the requisite graces and gifts, but only such men (1 Tim 5:22). In addition, the men of the 
            congregation should seek to cultivate the graces and gifts required for the eldership, since 
            godly desire for this office is highly commended (1 Tim 3:1).

    <div class="article_content">

            If in the providence of God Trinity Church Southside were to have only one elder, the church should 
            pray fervently that God would raise up others (Mt 9:37–38). The sole elder, with the consent of the 
            congregation, is urged to seek spiritual oversight for himself and his family from the eldership of 
            a sister church with which we have intimate fellowship. He should seek counsel from these spiritual 
            overseers and from the church’s approved Advisory Council (see Article IV) in matters of importance 
            in the life of the church. However, his use of such counsel deprives him of none of the authority, 
            and relieves him of none of the responsibility, of his office as elder in this church.

    <div class="article_content">

            Paragraph C. Parity and Diversity of Elders. The elders are all equal in office and authority (Acts 
            20:28; Heb 13:17), but diverse in gift and function. Each elder must be “teachable” (1 Tim 3:2; 
            Titus 1:9) and must be engaged in private instruction and admonition and in the administration and 
            government of the church (Acts 20:28; 1 Thes 5:12; 1 Tim 5:17). However, some elders will be more 
            gifted by God, more experienced, more involved, and more proficient than others in executing various 
            dimensions of the pastoral office (Rom 12:3–8; 1 Cor 12:4–7). For example, some should be more 
            engaged in public preaching and teaching than others (1 Tim 5:17). In view of this diversity of 
            gift as well as the numerous and grave responsibilities of the office, it is highly desirable that 
            at least one elder should devote himself full-time to the work of preaching and teaching and the 
            oversight of the church as his calling in life (1 Cor 9:14). The church is responsible to give 
            adequate financial compensation, according to its ability and according to the evidence of a man’s 
            gift, especially, but not exclusively, to those elders who labor in the Word (Prov 3:27; 1 Tim 
            5:17–18).

            Paragraph D. Numbers of Elders and Length of Term. Since the church should endeavor to recognize

            the number of elders shall not be fixed. These may all continue in office as long as they remain 
            qualified, able, and willing to serve (1 Pet 5:2), and as long as they hold the confidence of the

            in Scripture, particularly in 1 Timothy 3:1–7 and Titus 1:5–9. Any man called to this office must 
            be able conscientiously to affirm his agreement with our Book of Confessions and his submission to 
            the Constitution of the church. Should he at any time change his convictions respecting these 
            standards, he is under moral obligation to make this fact known to the elders (Ps 34:13; Eph 4:25;

            While the office of deacon is a serving rather than a ruling office, God has promised a special 
            blessing to those who serve well as deacons (1 Tim 3:13). Deacons are responsible to administer the 
            ordinary business, secular affairs, and benevolent concerns of the church so that the elders may 
            devote themselves without distraction to the biblical priorities of their office (Acts 6:3–4). 
            Deacons must fulfill the duties of their office in cooperation with and under the oversight of the 
            elders (1 Tim 3:10; Acts 20:17, 28; 11:30).

            of having the scriptural qualifications for the office (Acts 6:3). These may all continue in office

            Paragraph A. General Statement. The local church, under the guidance of the Scriptures and in dependence 
            upon the Holy Spirit, is responsible to appoint men to the offices of elder and deacon. Each potential 
            officer should have a desire for the office, and the church should recognize the call of Christ as it 
            observes in the man evidence of the graces and gifts which Scripture requires for the particular office. 
            In no case may a man be nominated to either office without his prior consent (1 Tim 3:1; 1 Pet 5:2).

            (1) Nominations. Nominations to the office of elder or deacon shall be made by the 	elders (Acts 14:23; 
            Tit 1:5). In order to assist the elders in their task of nominating qualified men, the elders will seek 
            the input of the congregation by various means, such as a yearly advisory survey or asking individual 
            members for input during pastoral visits. Every member is urged seriously to consider whether he 
            perceives any men to be qualified for office and to communicate the names of such men to one of the 
            elders directly or through the means appointed by the elders, such as an advisory survey. The elders 
            will prayerfully and with biblical objectivity consider the input from the congregation and determine 
            whether any of the men recommended should be nominated.

            prayerfully to assess the nominee in the light of relevant passages of Scripture. Any member who has 
            reservations about the man’s fitness for office should contact him or one of the elders. Failure to resolve

            Paragraph A. Warrant for the Discipline of Officers. While elders are overseers of the flock, they are 
            themselves members of the flock. Therefore, each elder is under the oversight of his fellow elders and 
            is subject to the same discipline as are all the members of the church, but he must adhere to a more 
            rigorous standard of conduct than other members (Gal 2:14; 1 Tim 5:20). Deacons likewise are under the 
            oversight of the elders and are subject to the discipline of the church. In addition to the ordinary 
            structures of public reproof and censure, suspension of privileges, and excommunication, officers are 
            subject to removal from office as part of the disciplinary action of the church (1 Tim 3:2).

            Paragraph B. Procedure for the Discipline of Officers. The process of discipline may be initiated either 
            by the elders or by individual members of the congregation. Any member who is offended by the behavior 
            of any church officer should first approach that officer privately and express his concerns. If the 
            concerns are not resolved, the member should inform the elders of the situation and wait upon them in 
            the determination of the matter (Mt 18:15ff). In the case where a sole elder is involved in such 
            proceedings, the Advisory Council shall assume responsibility to investigate the matter and to recommend 
            congregational action if they judge it to be warranted.

            Since this is such a delicate and serious matter, the elders shall proceed with due caution and earnest 
            prayer (1 Tim 5:19; Prov 19:2). If the elders judge public discipline or removal from office to be 
            necessary, they shall inform the congregation of the basis for the proposed action. If the congregation 
            consents to impose corrective discipline or excommunication upon the officer under any of the terms in 
            Article VI, he shall be removed automatically from office.
