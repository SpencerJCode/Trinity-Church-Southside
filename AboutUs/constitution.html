            Desiring to govern ourselves according to the principles of Scripture and to do all things in love, 
            we, the members of Trinity Church Southside, do ordain and establish the following articles, to 
            which we voluntarily submit ourselves.

            Section 1. In submission to the Scripture, we confess the purpose of this church is to glorify 
            God (Rom. 11:36; 1 Cor 10:31; Eph 3:20–21) through knowing (2 Cor 11:3; Col 3:2), loving (Dt 6:4–9;
             Mt 22:34–40; Jn 14:15), and enjoying (Job 22:24–26; Hab 3:17–18; Phil 4:4) Christ Jesus 
             (2 Cor 4:1–6; Col 1:13–20; Phil 2:5–11) by the Spirit (Mt 3:16–17; Jn 15:26).

        <div class="text_spaced">
            Section 2. The primary means for the accomplishment of this purpose are the public and private 
            ministry of the Word of God, prayer, fellowship, and the ordinances of baptism and the Lord’s 
            Supper (Acts 2:41–43).

    </div>
    <div class="article_content">

            Section 3. To fulfill this purpose, this church will endeavor by the grace of the Lord to 
            cultivate and practice the basic Christian principles of love (Mt 22:34–40; John 13:34–35; 
            Rom 13:10; 1 Cor 13) and self-denial (Mt 16:24–28; Phil 2:1–5).

            Section 1. We adopt as the fullest expression of our faith the Second London Baptist Confession 
            of Faith of 1689 (2LBC). The ultimate authority in all matters of faith and practice is the 
            Bible alone, which truth is clearly set forth in the opening article of the Confession itself. 
            This historic document, albeit imperfect, is an excellent summary of the things most surely 
            believed among us, and we find it to be an assistance in controversy, a confirmation in faith, 
            and a means of edification in righteousness.

    <div class="article_content">
        <div class="text_spaced">
            Section 2. Other creeds and confessions express an important part of who we are as a church. We 
            confess and believe together with our fathers in the faith and our brothers throughout the world
             (1 Cor 14:36; Gal 3:28; 1 Cor 3:1–4). We are baptized into their company as members of the same
              body, the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with them we eat of a common loaf and drink 
              from a common cup; their creed is our creed, even as their life is our life—one Lord, one 
              faith, and one baptism (Eph 4:4–6). We therefore subscribe to the following, holding them to 
              be a faithful witness to what the Scriptures teach, and as a means of identifying with the 
              broader Church: the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, the Definition of Chalcedon, the 
              Athanasian Creed, and the Canons of Dort.

            Section 1. We acknowledge no ecclesiastical authority other than our Lord Jesus Christ, who is 
            the Head of the Church (Eph. 5:23) and who directs the affairs of the church through elders 
            chosen and ordained according to the precepts of Holy Scripture (Acts 14:21–23; 1 Tim 3:1–13; 
            Titus 1:5–9). The elders themselves at all times and in all their activities stand under the 
            authority of Holy Scripture (Acts 16:4; 1 Cor 7:17).

            seek the counsel (Prov 11:14; 1 Thes 2:14) of other churches in matters of special importance
             and concern to us, but the decision of no other church, group of churches, or council shall 
             ever be binding on this church (Acts 14:21–23; Phil 4:15; 2LBC 26:15).

            concern which threaten the integrity, unity, or biblical order of this congregation (Acts 15:2).

              Christ (Acts 2:37–42; 5:14; 8:12; 16:30–34; 20:21), who manifests a life transformed by the

            Paragraph A. Pastoral Examination. A person who desires to become a member of this church shall
             make it know to the elders by submitting a completed membership form. The elders will visit 
             with the individual and seek to determine whether that person has a credible profession of 
             faith in Christ, believes the Bible as contained in the sixty-six books of the Old and New 
             Testaments to be the inspired Word of God and the only rule of faith and obedience, is in 
             agreement with the Apostles’ Creed, has been baptized, is willing to submit to the government

              of church membership, and intends to give wholehearted support to its ministry (Acts 9:26–27

            Paragraph B. Pastoral Inquiry. If the prospective member is or has been a member of another 
            church, efforts will be made to determine the person’s standing in that church and his reasons
             for leaving (Acts 15:1–2 with 24–25). If a former church raises an objection which the elders
              consider valid (3 Jn 8–10), membership may be denied or delayed at the discretion of the 
              elders.

            Paragraph C. Congregational Counsel. If the elders are satisfied that the prospective member 
            meets the requirements for membership, they shall announce the same to the congregation at a
             stated meeting of the church. At least two weeks will be allowed for objections or questions
              to be raised privately with the elders concerning the applicant’s manner of life or 
              doctrine. If no objection is raised, the person will be publicly received into the 
              membership during the next public gathering on the Lord’s Day. The elders shall postpone 
              the reception of a person into membership until any objections are investigated and

            and His gospel work for their salvation and their commitment to His Lordship by endeavoring 
            to love (Jn 13:34–35), by practicing self-denial through the ordinary means of grace (the 
            word, prayer, and fellowship; Acts 2:42), and by submitting to the government and discipline 
            of the church (Heb 13:17; see Article VI Section 1). They then shall be asked to read and 
            affirm their belief in the articles of faith expressed in the Apostles’ Creed. The members 
            of the congregation shall then be asked to express their consent to his reception (Acts 9:

        <div class="text_spaced">
            <span>Paragraph A. Ways of Termination.</span>
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) By Death. When a member of the church dies, his name shall be removed from the 
                membership roll (Heb 12:23).</span>
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) By Transfer. When it is so requested, the elders may grant to a member in good 
                standing a letter of commendation to another church (Acts 18:27). No such letter may 
                be given to a member who is under corrective church discipline. The elders may refuse
                 to send a letter of commendation to any church which is in their judgment disloyal 
                 to the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints (Jude 3) or which does 
                 not exercise godly care over its members (Heb 13:17).</span>
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) By Resignation. Membership in Trinity Church Southside is entered and initiated 
                jointly, by voluntary commitment from the individual and consent by the church, 
                expressed in terms of the procedures described in Section 3 of this Article. 
                Accordingly, members cannot ordinarily terminate their membership unilaterally. As a 
                general rule, a member may voluntarily resign from membership in Trinity Church 
                Southside. In such cases, the member should first consult with the elders. However, 
                a resignation offered 	by a person guilty of sin which warrants corrective discipline
                 will be regarded as invalid, and the church may proceed with public censure, suspension
                  of privileges, or excommunication in accordance with the procedures outlined in 
                  Article VI (Acts 15:24; 1 Jn 2:18–19 with 2 Jn 7–11).</span>
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) By Exclusion. If a member ceases to encourage others by abandoning the regular 
                fellowship of the church without showing just cause (Heb 10:24–25), he may be excluded 
                from the membership. In such cases the elders shall try to contact the person and 
                resolve the situation (Ezek 34:4). If these efforts are unavailing, the elders shall 
                recommend to the congregation that the person be excluded. If a member not guilty of 
                sin which warrants corrective discipline renounces his commitment to submit to the 
                government and discipline of this church in keeping with the requirements of membership
                 listed in Section 1 or Section 2 paragraph D of this Article (Num 30:2; Deut. 23:21–23;
                  Ps 15:4; 24:4; Mt 5:37), and yet refuses to resign voluntarily, he may be excluded, 
                  but only after due admonition from the elders (2 Tim 2:24–26). In such cases the 
                  elders shall announce to the congregation by letter their recommendation to exclude 
                  the person and the grounds for such an action. Opportunity will be given for questions
                  , and if no objection is raised which the elders consider to be valid, the members of 
                  the congregation shall be asked to express their consent to the exclusion on the 
                  appointed Lord’s Day. The elders will inform the person, when feasible, that he is no
                   longer a member.</span>
            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) By Excommunication. According to the teaching of the Holy Scripture, a congregation 
                must cut off from its fellowship and membership any person who teaches or insists on 
                holding heretical doctrine, who impenitently conducts himself in a manner inconsistent 
                with his Christian profession, or who persists in disturbing the unity, peace, or purity 
                of the church (Mt 18:15ff; Rom 16:17–20; 1 Cor 5:1ff; Titus 3:10–11). The procedure to 
                be followed in such excommunication is set forth in Section 2 of Article VI of this 
                Constitution.</span>
