Psalm 19
Tune: Ash Grove 12.11.12.11
Example: “Let All Things Now Living”
1 The heavens are telling the glory of God, and
the skies are declaring the work of His hands.
2 For day after day they speak, pouring forth knowledge, and
night after night is displayed their expanse.
3 Their voice is not heard—there’s no speech and no word, but
4 their sound has gone forth to the end of the world.
5 The sun in the heaven comes forth like a bridegroom;
Rejoices as a strong man running his course.
BREAK
6 It rises at one end of heaven and travels;
Its circuit extends over all of the earth.
And nothing is hidden from its heat or glory,
And like it, God’s law shines with power and worth.
7 The law of Yahweh is most perfect and holy,
Reviving the soul and restoring the heart.
The statutes of Yahweh can be surely trusted;
They make wise the simple and truth do impart.
BREAK
8 The precepts of Yahweh are right, making joyful;
Commands of Yahweh are pure, lighting the eyes.
9 The fear of Yahweh is enduring forever;
His judgments are true and right, making us wise.
10 They are much more precious than gold, and much sweeter
than honey and honeycomb where honey’s stored;
11 Moreover, by them is Your servant instructed.
In keeping Your statutes, there is great reward.
BREAK
12 But who can discern his own faults and his errors?
Forgive all my hidden sins—let them not rule!
13 Then I will be blameless, complete, and acquitted
of every transgression that besets the fool.
14 May all of the words of my mouth and the thoughts of
my heart be accepted Yahweh, in Your sight;
O Yahweh, my Rock and my mighty Redeemer,
May my life be pleasing and lived in Your light.
