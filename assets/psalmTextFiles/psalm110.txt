Psalm 110
TUNE: All SAINTS NEW CMD
Example: The Son of God Goes Forth To War
1 Yahweh unto my Lord has said,
"Sit Thou at My right hand
Until I make Thy foes a stool
Whereon Thy feet may stand."
2 Yahweh He shall from Zion send
The scepter of Thy pow'r.
In battle with Thine enemies
be Thou the conqueror.
BREAK
3 A willing people in Thy day
Of pow'r shall come to Thee.
Thy youth arrayed in holiness
Like morning dew shall be.
4 Yahweh He swore, and from His oath
He never will depart:
"In th'order of Melchizedek
A priest Thou ever art."
BREAK
5 The Lord at Thy right hand shall smite
Earth's rulers in His wrath.
6 Among the nations He shall judge;
The slain shall fill His path.
In many lands He'll overthrow
Their kiungs with ruin dread;
7 And, marching, He'll drink from the brook
And so lift up His head.
