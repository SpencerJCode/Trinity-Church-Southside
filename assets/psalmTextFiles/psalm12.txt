Psalm 12
Tune: MARTYRDOM 8686 (CM)
Example: “Alas, and Did My Savior Bleed”
1 To You, Yahweh, we cry for help,
Because the godly cease;
And from among the sons of men
The faithful now decrease.
BREAK
2 And to his neighbor every one
Doth utter vanity;
They with a double heart do speak
And lips of flattery.
BREAK
3 Yahweh will cut off all false lips,
Tongues that speak proudly thus:
4 “We’ll with our tongue prevail; our lips
Are ours; who’s lord o’er us?”
BREAK
5 “Because the poor are sorely pressed,
Because the needy sighs,
To give the safety they desire,”
Yahweh says, “I’ll arise.”
BREAK
6 The words of Yahweh are most pure;
They are like silver tried
In earthen furnace, seven times
That has been purified.
BREAK
7 Yahweh, Thou shalt preserve and keep
8 Forever from this race.
On ev’ry side the wicked walk,
With vile men high in place.
