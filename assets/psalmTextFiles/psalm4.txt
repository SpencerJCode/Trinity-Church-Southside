Psalm 4
Tune: GORDON 11.11.11.11.
Example: “My Jesus, I love Thee”
1 Answer when I call, O God Who justifies.
In my stress You freed me; In grace hear my cries
2 Sons of men, how long will you my glory shame?
Will you love what’s worthless? Will lies be your aim?
BREAK
3 Know Yahweh His saints has set apart in grace,
And Yahweh will hear me when I seek His face.
4 Tremble in your anger, yet from sin depart.
On your bed in silence speak within your heart.
BREAK
5 May you sacrifice now sacrifices just.
In Yahweh, Him only placing all your trust.
6 “Who will show us goodness?” many people say;
The light of Your face, Yahweh, upon us lay.
BREAK
7 You have given my heart greater joy by far
Than when grain and new wine most abundant are.
8 So in peace I lie down; I will rest and sleep,
For, Yahweh, You only will me safely keep.
