Psalm 15
Tune: BETHANY 64.64.66.64.
Example: “Nearer, My God, to Thee”
1 Who Yahweh in Thy tent
Abides with Thee,
And on Thy holy hill
A dweller be?
2 Who walks in uprightness,
Who worketh righteousness,
Who doth the truth express
Unfeignedly;
BREAK
3. Whose tongue doth not defame
Nor harm his friend,
Who to his neighbor’s shame
No ear doth lend,
4 Who has the vile abhorred
But honor doth accord
To those who fear Yahweh
And Him attend.
BREAK
When to his hurt he swears
Naught changes he;
5 His gold no increase bears
From usury;
His hands no bribes receive
The guiltless to aggrieve.
Lo, he who thus doth live
Unmoved shall be.
