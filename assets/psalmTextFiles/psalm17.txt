Psalm 17
Tune: THANKFULNESS (CMD)
Example: My Heart is Filled with Thankfulness
1 Give ear to what is right, Yahweh!
O listen to my cry!
Give heed to this my earnest prayer
From lips which do not lie.
2 May judgment from Your presence come
Which will me vindicate,
And always may Your searching eyes
See what is just and straight.
BREAK
3 For You have scrutinized my heart;
You came to me by night.
You’ve probed and found no ill intent;
My mouth speaks only right.
4 From acts of men, from violence,
I’m guarded by Your word;
5 My steps held closely to Your paths;
My footsteps have not erred.
BREAK
6 On You, O God, my soul has called,
For You will answer me.
O listen to my earnest words!
Incline Your ear to me!
7 In wondrous ways show mercy,
O You preserving those
Who seek to find at Your right hand
A refuge from their foes.
BREAK
8 Keep me the pupil of Your eye;
Beneath Your wings me hide
9 From wicked men and deadly foes
Who press on every side.
10 They are enclosed in their own fat;
Their boasting words abound.
11 They compass us and fix their eyes
To cast us to the ground.
BREAK
12 My enemy’s a lion strong
That craves to tear his prey.
He’s like a lion young that lurks
In ambush every day.
13 Arise, Yahweh. Confront my foe.
O bring him very low!
O save my soul from wicked men!
Let them feel Your sword’s blow.
BREAK
14 Save me by Your own hand, Yahweh,
From worldly men of earth,
Who only in this present life
Know anything of worth.
You filled them with the wealth You stored,
Their children satisfied;
So they may leave enough behind
Their young ones to provide.
BREAK
15 But as for me, with righteousness
Shall I behold Your face.
I shall be satisfied to wake
And see You face to face.
