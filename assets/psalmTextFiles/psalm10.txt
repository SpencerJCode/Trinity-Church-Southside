Psalm 10
Tune: CAROL 8.6.8.6. D (CMD)
Example: “It Came Upon the Midnight Clear”
1 Why, Yahweh, do you go and hide in times of trial and pain?
2 The wicked ones in arrogance afflict the weak for gain.
Let them be caught in schemes they plan; the wicked boast indeed!
3 They boast of cravings in their heart, detest Yahweh, bless greed.
BREAK
4 In pride they do not seek Him, and they think, “There is no God!”
5 They prosper and consider all Your judgments as a fraud.
6 They sneer at foes and think these words: “For nothing can shake me.
I’ll always know this happiness, and trouble I’ll not see.”
BREAK
7 His mouth is full of lies and threats, and evils on his tongue.
8 He waits to ambush innocent, to murder old or young.
9 For victims he in secret waits, like lions wait for prey;
He lurks that he may seize the poor and drag them off to slay.
BREAK
10 He crushes helpless ones who sink and fall down hopelessly.
11 He says, “God has forgotten this, and He will never see.”
12 Arise, Yahweh, lift up Your hand; forget not those in need!
13 Why do the wicked detest God, and say, “He will not heed”?
BREAK
14 But You have seen our woe and grief; You take it all to mind.
The helpless ones know You’re their help; a father orphans find.
15 O break the arm of evil ones; call them before Your throne.
May all their deeds come into light, in judgment be made known.
BREAK
16 Yahweh is King for evermore, the nations will not stand.
17 Yahweh, You hear the cries of all afflicted in the land.
18 For You defend the fatherless, and justice You’ll outpour
so that a mere mortal of earth may terrify no
