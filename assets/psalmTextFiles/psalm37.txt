Psalm 37
ST. LOUIS 8686 8686 (CMD)
“O Little Town of Bethlehem”
1 Have no disturbing thoughts about
Those doing wickedly,
And be not envious of those
Who work iniquity.
2 For like the growing grass
Soon be cut down shall they;
And like the green and tender plant
They all shall fade away.
BREAK
3 Set thou thy trust upon Yahweh;
Continue doing good.
Dwell thou securely in the land:
Make faithfulness thy food.
4 Delight yourself in Yahweh
Desires He’ll give to you
5 Commit thy way unto Yahweh;
Trust Him and He will do.
BREAK
8 Cease being thou by anger stirred;
Make thou of wrath an end.
Fret not thyself, for fretting will
To evildoing tend.
9 For evildoers shall be
Cut off, no more to stand;
But those who wait upon Yahweh
Inherit shall the land.
BREAK
15 But yet the sword which they have drawn
Shall enter their own heart;
Their bows which they are bending shall
In broken pieces part.
16 The little of the righteous
Is more and better far
Than great abundance many have
Who wholly wicked are.
BREAK
17 For wicked arms shall broken be;
Yahweh the just sustains.
18 Yahweh knows days of perfect men;
Their heritage remains.
19 They shall not be ashamed when
The time of evil see;
And when the days of famine come
They satisfied shall be
BREAK
24 Though he may stumble, he shall not
Fall so he cannot stand,
Because Yahweh, He is the One
Who holds him by his hand
25 I have been young and now old
and one thing must be said,
I've never seen the righteous left,
His children begging bread.
BREAK
26 All day he's gracious and he lends;
His sons a blessing are.
27 Depart from evil, and do good,
And dwell for evermore.
28 Because Yahweh loves justice
And never leaves His own,
They are preserved for evermore,
But sinners overthrown.
BREAK
33 Yahweh will never leave the just
Within the wicked's hands,
Nor let the righteous be condemned
When he in judgment stands.
34 Wait for Yahweh keep His way,
Exalt you then shall He
That you inherit shall the land,
The wicked's ruin see,
BREAK
35 I saw the wicked, ruthless man,
A tree whose leaves abound.
36 I passed one day and he was gone,
Though sought, could not be found
37 Consider well the blameless
The upright watch and see
For certainly the man of peace
Shall have posterity.
BREAK
38 But those who are transgressors will
Be wiped out one and all.
Posterity of wicked men
Will be cut off and fall.
39 Salvation of the righteous
Is from Yahweh alone.
He will a perfect refuge be
In times distress is known
BREAK
40 Yahweh helps and He rescues,
He will deliver them
From wicked men; He will save them
Their refuge is in Him
