Psalm 13
Tune: PASSION CHORALE 76.76.D
Example: “O Sacred Head Now Wounded”
1 How long wilt Thou forget me?
Shall it forever be?
Yahweh, how long neglect me,
And hide Thy face from me?
2 How long my soul take counsel,
Thus sad in heart each day?
How long shall foes exulting,
Subject me to their sway?
BREAK
3 Yahweh, my God, consider,
And hear my earnest cries;
Lest I in death should slumber,
Enlighten Thou mine eyes:
4 Lest foes be heard exclaiming
Against him we prevailed;
And they that vex my spirit
Rejoice when I have failed.
BREAK
5 But on Thy lovingkindness
I ever have relied;
With joy in Thy salvation
My heart shall still confide.
6 And I with voice of singing
Will praise Yahweh alone,
Because to me His favor
He has so largely shown.
