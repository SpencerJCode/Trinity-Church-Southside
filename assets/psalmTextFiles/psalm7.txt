Psalm 7
Tune: FINLANDIA 10.10.10.10.10.10.
Example: “Be Still, My Soul”
1 Yahweh my God, in You I refuge take.
O save me from all those who me pursue.
2 Lest he should like a lion tear my soul
And drag me off, with none to rescue me.
3 Yahweh my God, if wrong is in my hands,
4 If I did evil to my friend or foe,
BREAK
In triumph over them return on high.
8 Yahweh now sits to judge the peoples all.
Vindicate me, Yahweh, in righteousness,
According to integrity in me.
9 O let the evil of the wicked cease,
But every righteous one establish firm,
BREAK
For You it is Who tries the minds and hearts;
O Righteous God, You are the Judge of men.
10 My shield and my defense is found with God,
For He it is Who saves the right in heart.
11 A righteous judge, God judges righteously,
And God is filled with anger ev’ry day.
BREAK
12 If one does not repent, God whets His sword;
He has His bow already strung and bent.
13 He has prepared His instruments of death;
He makes His arrows fiery, deadly shafts.
14 See how the wicked evil thoughts conceives,
Is pregnant with ill will, and brings forth lies.
BREAK
15 He digs a pit, but stumbles in himself;
16 On his own head his plotted malice falls.
17 I will give thanks to Him Who is Yahweh
According to His perfect righteousness:
And I will sing with psalms for evermore
The name of Him Who is Yahweh Most High.
