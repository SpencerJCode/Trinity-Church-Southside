Psalm 24
Tune: TO GOD BE THE GLORY 11.11.11.11
Example: “To God Be the Glory”
1 The earth and the riches with which it is stored,
Belong to Yahweh Whose is all of the world.
2 For He on the seas its foundation has laid,
And firm on the waters its pillars has stayed.
3 O who shall the mountain of Yahweh ascend?
Or who in the place of His holiness stand?
4 The man of pure heart and of hands without stain,
Who has not sworn falsely nor loved what is vain.
BREAK
5 He carries away from Yahweh a blessing,
And justice from the God of his salvation.
6 Thus looking to Him is a whole blessed race,
All those who, like Jacob, are seeking Your face.
7 O gates, lift your heads! Ageless doors, lift them high!
The great King of glory to enter draws nigh!
8 O who is the King that in glory draws near?
O Yahweh, mighty Yahweh of war is here!
BREAK
9 O gates, lift your heads! Ageless doors, lift them high!
The great King of glory to enter draws nigh!
10 This great King of glory, O Who can He be?
Yahweh of armies, King of glory is He!
