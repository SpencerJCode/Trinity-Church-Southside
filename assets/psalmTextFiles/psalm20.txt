Psalm 20
Tune: SPANCIL HILL
Example: "Spancil Hill"
1 O may Yahweh give heed to you when troubled days are nigh;
And may the name of Jacob’s God protect you from on high.
2 May He send help to you from His own sanctuary true;
From Zion, His own holy hill, may He give strength to you.
BREAK
3 May He recall your sacrifice; your off’rings may He heed.
4 May He give you your heart’s desire; make all your plans succeed.
5 And we will sing for joy in your salvation’s victory.
We’ll lift our banners in God’s Name; May Yahweh grant your plea.
BREAK
6 Yahweh saves His anointed one, and from His holy heav’n,
I know He answers him with pow’r that His right hand has giv’n.
7 Some put their trust in char-i-ots; on horses some rely;
But we trust in God’s name alone, Yahweh our God on high.
BREAK
8 They’re brought down to their knees but we have risen standing tall.
9 O Yahweh, hear and save the king! Give answer when we call!
