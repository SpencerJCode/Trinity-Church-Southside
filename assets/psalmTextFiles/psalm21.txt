Psalm 21
Tune: KINGSFOLD 8686.8686 (CMD)
Example: “O Sing a Song of Bethlehem”
1 The king in Thy great strength, Yahweh
Shall very joyful be;
And in Thy saving help he shall
Rejoice most fervently.
2 For Thou upon him hast bestowed
All that his heart would have;
And Thou from him didst not withhold
Whate’er his lips did crave.
BREAK
3 For Thou wilt meet him with Thy gifts
Of blessings manifold,
And Thou hast set upon his head
A crown of purest gold
4 When he requested life of Thee,
Thou life to him didst give;
Such length of days Thou gavest him
He evermore should live.
BREAK
5 In Thy salvation he is great,
And glorified is he;
And Thou upon him hast bestowed
Most glorious majesty.
6 For Thou wilt ever set on him
The blessings of Thy grace,
And Thou wilt cause him to be filled
With joy before Thy face.
BREAK
7 Because the king trusts in Yahweh,
Through cov’nant love that’s proved,
Through grace of Him Who is Most High,
The king shall not be moved.
8 Thy hand shall reach to ev’ry man
Who is thine enemy,
And Thy right hand shall find out all
Who hate Thee needlessly.
BREAK
9 For Thou wilt make them blaze as fire
In presence of Thy power.
Yahweh shall swallow them in wrath;
The fire shall them devour.
10 Their offspring Thou wilt strike from earth,
Their seed from sons of men.
11 Their evil plans, their cunning plots
Against Thee are in vain.
BREAK
12 For Thou wilt make them turn their back;
Thou wilt Thine arrows place
Upon Thy strings, in readiness
To fly against their face.
13 In Thine omnipotence, Yahweh,
Exalt Thyself on high;
Then we shall sing and praise Thy name
Rejoice in Thy great might
