Psalm 11
Tune: TERRA BEATA 6686.6686 (SMD)
Example: “This Is My Father’s World”
1 My refuge is Yahweh
How can you say to me,
“Now like a bird from peril haste
And to your mountain flee!
2 The wicked bend the bow
With arrow fixed for flight
And stealthily in darkness go
The true in heart to smite.
BREAK
3 “Foundations are destroyed!
What can the righteous do?”
4 Yahweh is in His holy house;
In Heaven is His throne.
His eyes will surely see,
His eyelids test men’s sons.
5 Yahweh tries just and wicked men;
His soul hates violent ones.
BREAK
6 Upon all wicked men
He’ll rain entangling snares.
Brimstone and fire and burning wind
He for their cup prepares.
7 For righteous is Yahweh,
And He loves righteousness;
The upright will behold His face
And in His presence rest.
