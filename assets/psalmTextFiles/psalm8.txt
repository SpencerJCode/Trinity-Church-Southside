PSALM 8
TUNE: ODE TO JOY
EXAMPLE: ODE TO JOY
1 O Yahweh, our Lord, how awesome
is Your name in all the earth;
You display and set Your splendor
o’er the heav’ns which show Your worth.
2 From the mouths of infant children,
You establish strength and praise;
Make the enemy and vengeful
cease before Your wondrous ways.
BREAK
3 When I see Your glor-ious heavens,
moon and stars which You ordain;
4 What is man that You regard him,
son of man with care maintain?
5 Yet You made him slightly lower
than the angels high above;
Crowning him with glory, honor,
just beneath the God of love.
BREAK
6 You made him to rule creation,
put all things beneath his feet—
7/8 Sheep and oxen, beasts and cattle,
birds of heaven, fish of sea;
All that swim within the pathways
of the sea declare Your worth.
9 O Yahweh, our Lord, how awesome
is Your name in all the earth;
