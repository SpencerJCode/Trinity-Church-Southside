Psalm 14
Tune: SOUTHWELL
Example: Lord Jesus, Think On Me
1 The fool speaks in his heart,
“There is no God” he says.
They are corrupt, their deeds are vile,
None walk in godly ways
BREAK
2 Yahweh looks down from heav’n
Upon the human race
To see if any understand
If any seek God’s face
BREAK
3 They all have turned aside,
Corrupt they have become
Not one of them does any good,
No, not a single one
BREAK
4 Will sinners never learn?
My people they devour
As if they were consuming bread
They never seek Yahweh
BREAK
5 With dread they are struck down
For God is with the just
6 You evildoers shame the poor,
Who make Yahweh their trust
BREAK
7 May help from Zion come,
Yahweh His captives bring
And Jacob’s tribes will then rejoice,
And Isre’l gladly sing
