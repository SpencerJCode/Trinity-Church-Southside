Psalm 40
Tune: MADRID 6.6.6.6 D
Example: “Come Christians Join to Sing”
1 I waited for Yahweh;
2 He stooped and heard my cry.
He brought me from the pit,
Out of the dungeon mire,
My feet set on a rock,
My footsteps made secure.
3 My lips He gave a song,
A song to praise our God.
BREAK
Many will see with awe,
And so will trust Yahweh.
4 Blessed he who trusts in God,
And turns not to false men.
5 You’ve worked wonders, Yahweh;
No one compares to You!
Should I declare each one,
Their number is too great.
BREAK
You want no offering,
Nor ask a sacrifice,
But You have given me
A ready ear to hear
You ask no off’rings burnt
Nor sacrifice for sin.
7 So I say, "Here I come,
As in the scroll inscribed.
BREAK
8 "To do Your will, O God,
To me is my delight.
Your law is part of me,
9 Deep in my heart, O God."
In congregation great
I told Your righteousness.
You know, Yahweh, I spoke;
I did not close my lips.
BREAK
10 I hid not in my heart
Your truth and saving help;
Your faithfulness I preached
In the assembly great.
11 You'll not withhold from me
Your kind mercies, Yahweh,
And Your unfailing love
Will ever keep me safe.
BREAK
16 Let all men who seek You
Be glad and in You joy;
Who Your salvation love
Say, "How great is Yahweh!"
17 Though I'm in want and poor,
The Lord takes thought of me.
My Help, my Savior, come!
O God, do not delay!
