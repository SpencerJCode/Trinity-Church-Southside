Psalm 133
Tune: AULD LANG SYNE
Example: “All Glory Be to Christ”
Behold, how pleasant and how good,
And how becoming well
When brothers doth together, come
In unity, to dwell
BREAK
Such is a thing like precious oil
That down the head doth flow
Ev’n Aaron’s beard, there running to
The collar of his robes
BREAK
Like dew of Hermon, dew that doth
From Zion’s fastness flow
For there Yahweh, He did us bless,
With life forevermore
