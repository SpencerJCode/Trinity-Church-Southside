Psalm 2
Kiss Ye the Son
By: Brian Sauvé
Why do the heathen nations rage?
And foolish peoples plot in vain?
The kings of earth, they set themselves
In league their rulers all conspire
Against Yahweh, against the King
And His anointed One, they say,
“let us asunder, burst their bonds
and cast from us, their cords away!”
BREAK
He Who in heaven sits shall laugh
The Lord will mock them all to scorn
Then He will speak in wrath to them
A terror, He will vex them sore
And say to them, “Yea as for Me,
My King, I’ve set on Zion’s hill.”
His sure decree I will declare
All that Yahweh has said to me
BREAK
“You are My Son, and on this day
I have begotten Thee, and so
Ask Me and I will surely make
The nations Thine inheritance
The ends of earth, Ye shall possess
And Ye shall break the kings of men
With iron rod, as potter’s clay
Shall break them into pieces, then!”
BREAK
Now therefore o ye kings, be wise
Be warned ye rulers of the earth
Serve thou Yahweh and serve with fear
Rejoice with trembling, fear with mirth
Kiss ye, the Son lest in His wrath
Ye perish there, along the way
For quickly kindleth His wrath
But blessed are all who in Him stay
