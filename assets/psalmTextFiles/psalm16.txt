Psalm 16
Tune: TERRA BEATA
Example: “This Is My Father’s World”
1 O keep me safe, my God—I take refuge in Thee.
2 To Yahweh said, “You are my Lord; I have no good but Thee.”
3 As for Your saints on earth, they are the glo-rious ones;
The godly who are my delight—Your daughters and Your sons.
BREAK
4. Those who seek other gods, their sorrows will increase,
For chasing after emptiness will never bring them peace.
I will not join with them, blood offerings to make;
The names of idols, empty gods, on my lips I’ll not take.
BREAK
5 Yahweh‘s my portion and my cup, my sure defense;
For You have made my lot secure – You’re my inheritance.
6 The bound’ries of my life have fallen pleasantly;
My heritage, my sure repose, is beautiful to me.
BREAK
7 I’ll praise and bless Yahweh Who has instructed me;
Indeed, my heart and mind all night do counsel give to me.
8 For I have set Yahweh before me e’er to stand;
And I will never shaken be, for He’s at my right hand.
BREAK
9 Therefore, my heart is glad, my spirit does rejoice;
My flesh will also dwell secure, and I’ll lift up my voice.
10 You won’t abandon me to Sheol and the grave;
You won’t allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.
BREAK
11 You have made known to me the path of life, the way;
For in Your presence there is joy in all its full array.
At Your right hand are found both joy and pleasures’ store;
For in Your presence, at Your hand, are pleasures evermore.
