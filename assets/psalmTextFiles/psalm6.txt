Psalm 6
Tune: “Before the Throne of God Above”
Example: “Before the Throne of God Above”
1 In anger, Yahweh, don’t rebuke,
Nor judgment in Your wrath decide.
2 My weakness, Yahweh, pity, heal,
For in my bones I’m terrified.
3 My soul is in me terrified.
Yahweh, and yet how long You take!
4 Return, Yahweh; my soul set free,
And save me for Your mercies’ sake.
BREAK
5 For none can mention You in death,
Or there shall Your remembrance keep,
In Sheol who will give you thanks?,
Within the confines of the deep.
6 My groaning all day wearies me,
Through ev’ry night till morn appears.
My grieving makes my bed to swim
And waters all my cot with tears.
BREAK
7 Because of all my enemies
This grief is making weak my eyes.
8 Then let all evil men depart!
Yahweh has heard my weeping cries.
9 Yahweh hears my suppliant cries.
Yahweh has my prayers brought to mind.
10 My foes shall be vexed and ashamed,
And sudden shame they all will find.
