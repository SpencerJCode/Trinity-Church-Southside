Psalm 90
TUNE: MELITA 88.88.88
“Eternal Father Strong to Save”
1 Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling place
Through all the ages of our race.
2 Before the mountains had their birth,
Or ever Thou hads’t formed the earth,
From years which no beginning had
To years unending, Thou art God.
BREAK
3 Thou turnest man to dust again,
And say'st, "Return, ye sons of men."
4 As yesterday when past appears,
So are to Thee a thousand years;
They like a day are in Thy sight,
Yes, like a passing watch by night.
BREAK
5 Thou with a flood hast swept men on;
They like a sleep are quickly gone.
They are like grass which grows each morn;
6 Its blades of green the fields adorn.
At morn its sprouts and blossoms rise;
At eve, cut down, it withered lies.
BREAK
7 For by Thine anger we're consumed,
And by Thy wrath to terror doomed.
8 Our sins Thou in Thy sight dost place,
Our secret faults before Thy face;
9 So in Thy wrath our days we end,
And like a sigh our years we spend.
BREAK
10 For some life's years are seventy;
Perhaps the strong may eighty see;
Their best involves but toil and woe;
All quickly ends. How soon we go!
11 Who has Thine anger understood?
Who fears Thy fury as he should?
BREAK
12 O teach Thou us to count our days
And set our hearts on wisdom's ways.
13 How long, Yahweh? Return! Repent,
And toward Thy servants now relent.
14 Each morning fill us with Thy grace;
We'll sing for joy through all our days.
BREAK
15 According to the days we spent
Beneath affliction Thou hast sent,
And all the years we evil knew,
Now make us glad, our joy renew.
16 Thy work in all Thy servants show;
Thy glory on their sons bestow.
BREAK
17 On us let there be shed abroad
The beauty of Yahweh our God.
Our handiwork upon us be
Established evermore by Thee.
Yes, let our handiwork now be
Established evermore by Thee.
