PSALM 1
Tune: SPANCIL HILL 8.6.8.6. (C.M.)
Example: "Spancil Hill"
1  O greatly blessed is the man
Who walketh not astray
In counsel of ungodly men,
Nor stands in sinners’ way.
BREAK
2  Nor sittith in the scorner’s chair,
But placeth his delight
Upon God’s law, and meditates
On His law day and night.
BREAK
3  He shall be like a tree that grows
Set by the water side,
Which in its season yields its fruit,
And green its leaves abide;
BREAK
And all he does shall prosper well.
4  The wicked are not so,
But are like chaff which by the wind
Is driven to and fro.
BREAK
5  In judgment therefore shall not stand
Such as ungodly are,
Nor in the’assembly of the just
Shall wicked men appear.
BREAK
6  Because the way of godly men
Unto Yahweh is known,
Whereas the way of wicked men
Shall soon be overthrown.
