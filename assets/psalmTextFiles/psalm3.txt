Psalm 3
Tune: NEW BRITAIN 8.6.8.6. (C.M.)
“Amazing Grace”
1 O Yahweh, how my foes increased!
Against me many rise.
2 How many say, “In vain for help
He on his God relies!”
BREAK
3 Yahweh, my shield and my glory;
And lifter of my head.
4 I cried, “Yahweh!” and from His hill
To me His answer sped.
BREAK
5 I lay down, slept, and woke again
Yahweh is keeping me.
6 I will not fear ten thousand men
Entrenched surrounding me.
BREAK
7 Arise, Yahweh! Save me, my God!
You punish all my foes.
You smite the face of wicked men,
Their teeth break with your blows.
BREAK
8 Deliverance is from Yahweh,
Salvation His alone!
O let Your blessing evermore
Be on Your people shown!
