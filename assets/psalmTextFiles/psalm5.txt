Psalm 5
Tune: ABERYSTWYTH 7.7.7.7.D
Example: “Jesus Lover of My Soul”
1. Hearken, Yahweh, to my words
To my thoughts attentive be.
2 Hear my cry, my King, my God,
For I make my prayer to Thee.
3 With the morning light, Yahweh,
Thou shalt hear my voice and cry;
In the morn my prayer arrange
And keep constant watch will I.
BREAK
4. Truly Thou are not a God
That in sin doth take delight;
Evil shall not dwell with Thee,
5 Nor the proud stand in Thy sight.
Evildoers Thou dost hate;
6 Liars Thou wilt bring to naught.
GOD abhors the man who loves
Deed of blood or lying thought.
BREAK
7 But in Thine abundant grace
To Thy house will I repair;
Looking to Thy holy place,
In Thy fear I’ll worship there.
8 Since, Yahweh, mine enemies
For my soul do lie in wait,
Lead me in Thy righteousness;
Make Thy way before me straight.
BREAK
9 For they flatter with their tongue;
In their mouth no truth is found;
Like an open grave their throat;
All their thoughts with sin abound.
10 Hold them guilty, O my God;
Them for all their sins expel;
Let them fall by their own craft,
For against Thee they rebel.
BREAK
11 But let all that trust Thy care
Ever glad and joyful be;
Let them joy who love Thy name,
For they guarded are by Thee.
12 And a blessing rich, Yahweh,
To the righteous Thou wilt yield;
Thou wilt compass him about
With Thy favor as a shield.
