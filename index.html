        We exist to glorify God through knowing, loving, and enjoying Christ Jesus by the Spirit. 
        We believe the mind is the channel through which the heart is engaged. We believe, as Jesus 
        taught (Luke 24, John 5), that both the Old and New Testaments testify to the person and 
        work of Christ Jesus. The Bible is the means to knowing Jesus. ‘And though we have not seen 
        him, we love him; and though we do not see him now, we believe in him and are filled with 
        an inexpressible and glorious joy’ (1 Peter 1:8). We believe that real affections for Jesus 
        necessarily lead to real enjoyment of Jesus together. And because no person can keep the 
        things they truly love and enjoy to themselves, we invariably tell others about Jesus, who 
        ‘came into the world to save sinners’ (1 Timothy 2:15).

        We invite you to gather with us as we ‘fix our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of 
        faith who for the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down 
        at the right hand of the throne of God’ (Hebrews 12:2). Join us as we ‘consider him who 
        endured such opposition from sinners’ (v. 3). We are an imperfect people who believe that 
        Jesus came ‘not to call the righteous but the sinner’ (Luke 5:32). We gather as a broken yet 
        redeemed people to grow in the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. We hope to meet you and that 
        together—by the grace of God—we might ‘know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, 
        that we may be filled with all the fulness of God’ (Ephesians 3:19).
