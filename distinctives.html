            We exist to Glorify God through knowing, loving, and enjoying Christ Jesus by the Spirit. Christ 
            is prophet, priest, and king. The gospel transforms got-tos into get-tos (Mt. 11:28–30; John 14:15). 
            This distinctive isn’t one of many; it’s not “Jesus and” but “Jesus, and so.”

            We are worshiping beings. Worship is theocratic (God-governed), not democratic (people-governed). 
            God supplies our needs based on what He wants for us, not what we want for us. And we respond to God 
            by making our sacrifices of thanksgiving and praise upon the altar of the world.

            Jesus Christ is the supreme legislator, judge, and commander in chief of heaven and earth, things 
            visible and invisible (Col. 1:16). The opposite of heaven is not hell but earth. The temple is heaven 
            on earth. At the incarnation, God tabernacled in human flesh (John 1:14). The cross is triumphant 
            (Col. 2:13–15). The ascension is enthronement (Acts. 1:9–11; Daniel 7:13–14). Christians are not 
            practical deists. Our faith is necessarily a public faith, the mission a global conquest, and this 
            is carried out by wielding the sword of the Scriptures (Psalm 2; Ephesians 6:17; Revelation 19:11–16). 
            Christ rules by His Word until, at the end, “God…will be utterly supreme over everything everywhere’ 
            (1 Corinthians 15:28). The final scene in Revelation is New Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from 
            God (Revelation 21:1–2). Heaven on earth. And because we are a praying people, we say by faith: ‘Your 
            Kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.’

            We joyfully affirm a Book of Confessions as a testimony to the work of the Spirit of Christ through 
            the ages. We believe salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone to the glory of 
            God alone, and that this is a truth taught by God in His Word (Ephesians 2:1-10). Knowing the Church 
            continues to work out its salvation with fear and trembling, we seek to imitate and imbibe the spirit 
            of our Protestant forebearers: Reformata, semper reformanda (“reformed, always reforming”).

            We’re not egalitarian; we gladly embrace authority structures and the mutual edification that exists 
            between them. Love and glory in the Godhead are evidenced in the virtues of masculinity and femininity, 
            and these are virtues are embodied in men and women respectively. Men are created to rule, sacrifice, 
            be responsible, and initiate. Women are created to submit, obey, give thanks, and respond. But 
            masculine and feminine virtues aren’t absolute. Men are also called to submit to other men (pastors, 
            bosses, governing authorities, etc.). And women are called to rule (mothers to their children, etc.). 
            We believe the rightly-ordered Christian household is the “nursery of church and commonwealth”. The 
            doctrine of sphere responsibility and the principle of subsidiarity outline these ordered relationships.

            The ordinary means of gospel growth in the world is household ministry (1 Timothy 2:8-3:16). This is 
            characterized by older men and women who humble themselves in order to love and nourish younger men 
            and women, while the younger men and women humble themselves in order to honor and support older men 
            and women (Titus 2; 1 Timothy 5). Children’s programs aren’t substitutes for the role of fathers in 
            discipling their children (Dt. 6:4-9; Eph. 6:4). We expect our fathers to be mindful of their 
            grandchildren as they raise their children (Prov. 13:22).

            God has ordered the days and years, and created mankind according to this pattern (Genesis 1:14). 
            Every culture has a calendar, and every calendar is a catechism. We strive to make the best use of 
            time, because the days are evil (Ephesians 5:16). The Lord’s day serves as a weekly holiday (“holy 
            day”), a holy resting and feasting in the Lord, and the reminder that Jesus is Lord (Psalm 118:24). 
            And a yearly Christian calendar (with feast days centered on the person and work of the Lord Jesus 
            Christ) protects against pagan feast days by fixing our eyes on Jesus.

            Public worship is a covenant renewal ceremony (Ex. 24) emphasizing two things: word and sacrament. 
            Although we gladly use the word ordinance, the word sacrament is embedded with the covenantal 
            terms and obligations which mark these practices. In the public gathering, we read, sing, pray, 
            and teach the Bible, and we endeavor by faith to practice the sacraments of baptism and the 
            Lord’s Supper with gravity and gladness.

            “You were at that time apart from Christ, alienated from the citizenship of Israel, and strangers to

            Baptists hold to a particular view of the covenants, and especially the New Covenant, distinct from 
            our Protestant brethren. Every covenant is sealed in blood. The New Covenant was foreshadowed in the 
            various covenants of promise (Ephesians 2:13), and ultimately sealed and made effective by the blood 
            of Jesus (Hebrews 10:29). So, we reject the teaching that an individual once in the New Covenant can 
            ever be taken out of it. And we believe an appropriate view of the covenants is connected to a right 
            use of the Law (see LBC 19).
