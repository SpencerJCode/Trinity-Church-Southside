            All of Christ for All of Life

            We exist to glorify God through knowing, loving, and enjoying Christ Jesus by the Spirit. 
            We believe the mind is the channel through which the heart is engaged. We believe, as Jesus 
            taught (Luke 24, John 5), that both the Old and New Testaments testify to the person and 
            work of Christ Jesus. The Bible is the means to knowing Jesus. <span class="frt-2">‘And though we have not seen 
            him, we love him; and though we do not see him now, we believe in him and are filled with 
            an inexpressible and glorious joy’</span> (1 Peter 1:8). We believe that real affections for Jesus 
            necessarily lead to real enjoyment of Jesus together. And because no person can keep the 
            things they truly love and enjoy to themselves, we invariably tell others about Jesus, who 
            <span class="frt-2">‘came into the world to save sinners’</span> (1 Timothy 2:15).

            We invite you to gather with us as we <span class="frt-2">‘fix our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of 
            faith who for the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down 
            at the right hand of the throne of God’</span> (Hebrews 12:2). Join us as we <span class="frt-2">‘consider him who 
            endured such opposition from sinners’</span> (v. 3). We are an imperfect people who believe that 
            Jesus came <span class="frt-2">‘not to call the righteous but the sinner’</span> (Luke 5:32). We gather as a broken yet 
            redeemed people to grow in the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. We hope to meet you and that 
            together—by the grace of God—we might <span class="frt-2">‘know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, 
            that we may be filled with all the fulness of God’</span> (Ephesians 3:19).
