            The Lord's Day

            As it is the law of nature, that in general a proportion of time, by God’s appointment, 
            be set apart for the worship of God, so by his Word, in a positive moral, and perpetual 
            commandment, binding all men, in all ages, he hath particularly appointed one day in 
            seven for a sabbath to be kept holy unto him (Ex 20:8), which from the beginning of the 
            world to the resurrection of Christ was the last day of the week, and from the 
            resurrection of Christ was changed into the first day of the week, which is called the 
            Lord’s Day (1Co 16:1-2; Act 20:7; Rev 1:10): and is to be continued to the end of the 
            world as the Christian Sabbath, the observation of the last day of the week being abolished 
            (2LBC 22.7).

            Thus, on the first day of the week, we come together to worship the guest of honor, the 
            Lord Jesus Christ. We’re a company of lawbreakers who believe God became a man in the 
            person of Jesus, and that at a moment in history He died for us and three days later 
            He was raised from the dead (on a Sunday, which is called the Lord’s Day). This good 
            news of the great God-man we come to celebrate.

            So, we assemble at 10a each Sunday to consider one another by paying homage the risen 
            King Jesus (Hebrews 10:24-25). And after, we feast together!
